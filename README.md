# Face-Detection-System-Real-or-Fake-
This project is a real-time AI-based face detection system that classifies faces as real or fake (e.g. photos, phone screens) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It is designed to enhance security by detecting fake or imprinted faces during webcam-based verification.


## How to run
Step 1
Run the FaceCollection.py
run splitData.py
for checking the errors and system
for checking the errors and system


step 2
Finally run the program and open the webcam
run the main.Py file
Open your webcam automatically and running the program and we take a real or fake faces
