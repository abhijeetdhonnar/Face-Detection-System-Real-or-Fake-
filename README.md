# Face-Detection-System-Real-or-Fake-
This project is a real-time AI-based face detection system that classifies faces as real or fake (e.g. photos, phone screens) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It is designed to enhance security by detecting fake or imprinted faces during webcam-based verification.
