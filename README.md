# Face-Detection-System-Real-or-Fake-
This project is a real-time AI-based face detection system that classifies faces as real or fake (e.g. photos, phone screens) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It is designed to enhance security by detecting fake or imprinted faces during webcam-based verification.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- âœ… YOLOv8-based classification: REAL vs FAKE
- âœ… Trained on a custom dataset of real and spoofed faces
- âœ… Blurriness filtering for high-quality data collection
- âœ… Auto-splitting dataset into train/val/test for model training
- âœ… Clear UI display with labels and confidence scores


- Python 3.8 â€“ 3.10 (recommended)
- [YOLOv8]
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- MediaPipe
